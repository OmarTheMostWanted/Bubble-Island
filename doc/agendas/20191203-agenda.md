- Can we use any hash or is a salt hash required? 
- explain “hardcoded file location in databaseconnection.java, let those "configuration" parameters reside in a central place so they can easily be modified.”
- “include a test coverage metric in CI, that shows its result in the CI output”
- Ask for feedback on assignment 1. Do we need to alter our requirements?
- Ask for feedback on backlog 2. Did we improve?
- Maybe ask for feedback about our class structure (controllers, requests, DAO, usage of mocks, etc.)
- what are the “out ” classes for?

- Decide on which features we need to implement before Friday, probably:
Authentication.
Shooting a ball.
Rotating the arrow.
Starting a new game (by clicking a “Start” button), drawing the board (with hexagon).


Decide on which classes to include in the diagram for ex 1:
SignupScreen, SignupRequest, UserDao, Controller
LoginScreen, Request, Dao, Controller
StartScreen, GameScreen, Bubble, ...

To do: 
hardcoded file location in databaseconnection.java, let those "configuration" parameters reside in a central place so they can easily be modified.
include a test coverage metric in CI, that shows its result in the CI output
didn't test the bubble ball logic
MR #14 has checkstyle warnings but were not resolved.
