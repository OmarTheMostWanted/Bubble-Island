## Main problems encountered

### Problem 1
**Description:** The workload per person was not equal this sprint, as our TA mentioned.

**Solution:** Next time, everyone needs to pay more attention to this.

### Problem 2
**Description:** Not everyone participated in making the diagrams for assignment 2.

**Solution:**  Certain members should take more initiative and be more involved in the assignments.

### Problem 3
**Description:** Some team members started very late on some issues, which made it hard to finish everything on time.

**Solution:** Everyone should start working on there issues on time, not just two days before the deadline.

### Problem 4
**Description:** Issues with merge request: 
* Titles were vague.
* Descriptions were missing.
* Threads were not resolved.
* Members started working on other members' branches without permission, which led to already received approvals to be lost.
* Members approved their own merge requests. 
* Members created unnecessary request while they could have just pulled from the other branch into their own.


**Solution:** Members need to communicate better and learn how to work with git(lab).

## Adjustments for the next sprint plan 

Everyone in the development team should be motivated and involved. During the next sprint we will all try to improve our communication, making use of GitLab and our group chat on WhatsApp. Hopefully members have learned from starting too late.
