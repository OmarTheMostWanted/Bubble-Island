The purpose of this game is to remove all bubbles in the centerpiece. Press play to start the game.

First press your left mouse button and move your cursor around. See how the arrow rotates accordingly? Now aim and release to shoot a bubble. Bubbles will bounce off of walls until they hit the centerpiece. A bubble will expire when it has been moving around for too long, to keep you from waiting.

Your goal is to form chains of at least three same-colored bubbles. By doing this, the bubbles will be eliminated and you are rewarded with points. Every bubble that was not shot by you is worth ten points.

The game is won when all bubbles have been eliminated. If you do this quick enough, you will be rewarded with a time bonus!

The game is lost when a bubble hits the edge of the screen. Be aware that the bubble structure will spin after being hit!
